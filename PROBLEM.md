# Cab Data Researcher is a company that provides insights on the open data about NY cab trips

 
Cab trips in NY are public available as csv downloadable files. In order to make it more useful we want to wrap the data in a public API.

 
## Data format is as follow:

``` 
medallion, hack_license, vendor_id, rate_code, store_and_fwd_flag, pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, passenger_count, trip_time_in_secs, trip_distance
```
 
The medallion is the cab identification.

 
Our API should provide a way to query how many trips a particular cab (medallion) has made given a particular pickup date ( using pickup_datetime and only considering the date part)

 
The API must receive one or more medallions and return how many trips each medallion has made.

 
Considering that the query creates a heavy load on the database, the results must be cached.


The API must allow user to ask for fresh data, ignoring the cache.

There must be also be a method to clear the cache.

 
What do we provide:

	
SQL statements to populate database from the csv
